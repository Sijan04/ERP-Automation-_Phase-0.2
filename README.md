# akaar-erp-unit-testing

This repository contains **automation test scripts** for the Akaar ERP system.  
The project is built with **Python, Selenium, and Faker** to perform automated testing of various ERP modules like login, HRM, employee creation, class management, and data deletion.

## 📌 Features
- **Automated Login** – Script for logging into the ERP application.
- **HRM Module Access** – Test navigation and accessibility of the HRM module.
- **Class Management**  
  - Add new classes with fake data.  
  - Delete existing classes from the list.
- **Employee Management**  
  - Create new employees using **Faker** (randomized names, emails, phone numbers, etc.).  
  - Validate employee entries in the system.
- **List Management** – Test deleting records from ERP lists.
- **Reusable Test Scripts** – Each module has an independent Python script for modular testing.
